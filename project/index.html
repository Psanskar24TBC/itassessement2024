                </p>
                <p class="text-small">A true reference for gourmets thanks to its unmissable specialties, this traditional bakery is located in a historic district of Paris. Dating from 1875, the bakery has retained its old-world decoration with its painted glass ceilings and beveled mirrors.

                    A historic place, the site of the Du Pain & des Idées bakery is naturally classified in the supplementary inventory of Historic Monuments.
                    
                    Driven by his passion for traditional baking, Christophe Vasseur took it over in February 2002 and has since continued to make it a place of history and emotion.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Fascinated by bread since childhood, a singular baker, Christophe Vasseur wanted this 
        book to reflect his image, different, by highlighting a whole constellation of professions around that of baker. Bread, 
        certainly, but what would it be without the work of the seed maker, the farmer, the miller or the lathe driver...?
        Homage also to the winegrower, the brother profession of the baker because he must control fermentation, this 
        key to taste. And to the cook, another worker of the land, who satisfies his guests by sublimating the products of Mother Nature.
        In short, a gallery of professions and characters of which you will discover that, without their passion, nothing would be as good,
         exceptionally good.
        And some recipes too…!</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">After being elected pastry chef of the year in 2004 and medalist 
        of the city of Paris in 2008, Gilles Marchal settled in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, on the
         Montmartre hill at 9 rue Ravignan. It is there, in this Paris enchanted by a village spirit, a
          privileged Paris where we take the time to live and get to know each other, that he finds the inspiration 
          and happiness to fully practice his profession.</p>
