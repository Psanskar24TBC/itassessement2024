        <p>Our bakery was founded in downtown
            Winston-Salem during the Great
            Depression. We became known for our
            thin, crisp Moravian Cookies, originally
            created by immigrants who journeyed 
           to our hometown in the 1700’s from the
            European kingdom of Moravia.</p>

    <div class="second">
        <img src="/img/1950.jpg" alt="1950img">
        <p>Sugar rationing during WWII made it difficult 
            to keep up with demand at the bakery, but our
             customers were happy to contribute. 
            Customers ordering cakes offered to bring in
             one cup of sugar to help in the production of 
            their cake.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
        <img src="img/1960.jpg" alt="1960img">
        <p>We shipped 12,000 pounds of fruitcake to 
            servicemen all over the world to thank them 
            for their wartime sacrifices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fourth">
        <img src="/img/1970.jpg" alt="1970img">
        <p>On Easter Monday in 1970 a fire destroyed 
            our bakery. The Winston-Salem community
             responded quickly to get us up and running 
            again by offering temporary space and 
            baking facilities.</p>       
    </div>
    <div class="fifth">
        <img src="/img/1980.webp" alt="1980img">
        <p>That same year, we moved into our flagship 
            location at Thruway Shopping Center and 
            are the only original business still here today.</p>

    <div class="sixth">

        <p>We created one of our most popular cookie
            flavors, Meyer Lemon. Made with grated
            lemon zest and cold pressed Meyer Lemon
            oil, the bright and zesty flavor of this cookie
            makes it a fan favorite!</p>

    <div class="seventh">
        <img src="/img/2000.jpg" alt="2000img">
        <p>Our cookies became a holiday staple and a 
            local favorite to enjoy at get-togethers or 
            give as gifts between families and friends
             (did you know they are also Santa’s favorite
             cookie?)</p>

    <div class="eigth">
        <img src="/img/2010.jpg" alt="2010img">
        <p>We created our Pink Lemonade Cake, a zesty, 
            one-of-a-kind flavor that has been a fan
             favorite ever since. Our recipe is a well-kept
             secret, and you’ll have to visit our 
            Winston-Salem, NC bakeries for a taste.</p>

        <p>After testing hundreds of recipes over the 
            years, we added Triple Ginger, Toasted

             cookie lineup.</p>

    <div class="tenth">
        <img src="/img/2021.jpg" alt="2021img">
        <p>As demand for our flavorful cookies grew, 
            we needed more baking space. We opened
             a commercial bakery just a few miles from
             our flagship location and continue to bake
             cookies and other treats there every day.</p>

        <p>Our original chocolate cookie had a glow-up, 
            transforming into our decadent Brownie Crisp
             cookie. These cookies are inspired by the flavor
             of the rich, indulgent brownies that we bake each
             morning at our hometown bakery.
